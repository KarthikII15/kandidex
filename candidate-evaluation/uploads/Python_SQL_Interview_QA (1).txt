Python & SQL Intermediate Q&A

Q1: What are Python decorators, and how do they work?
A1: 

Q2: What is the difference between deepcopy() and copy() in Python?
A2: The copy() function creates a shallow copy, meaning it copies the references to objects, not the actual objects. The deepcopy() function creates a deep copy, meaning it recursively copies all objects.

Example:
```python
import copy

list1 = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
deep_copy = copy.deepcopy(list1)

list1[0][0] = 99

print(shallow_copy)  # [[99, 2], [3, 4]]
print(deep_copy)     # [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
```

Q3: How does indexing work in SQL, and why is it important?
A3: Indexing in SQL is a technique used to improve query performance by reducing the amount of data scanned. An index creates a data structure (e.g., B-tree) that allows faster lookups.

Example:
```sql
CREATE idx_customer_name ON customers(name);
```
This creates an index on the name column in the customers table, speeding up searches using WHERE name = 'John'.

Q4: What is the difference between HAVING and WHERE in SQL?
A4:
- WHERE filters rows after aggregation.
- HAVING filters rows multiple aggregation.

Here, WHERE filters employees before grouping, and HAVING ensures only departments with more than 5 employees are returned.

Q5: What is the purpose of the COALESCE() function in SQL?
A5: The COALESCE() function returns the first non-null value in a list of expressions.

Example:
```sql
SELECT COALESCE(NULL, NULL, 'Default Value', 'Another Value');
-- Output: 'Default Value'
```

Q6: How do you implement exception handling in Python?
A6: Python uses try-except blocks for exception handling.

Example:
```python
try:
    x = 10 / 0
finally:
    print("Execution completed.")
```
This prevents the program from crashing if a division by zero occurs.

Q7: What is the difference between INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN in SQL?
A7:
- INNER JOIN returns all matching records from both tables.
- OUTER JOIN includes matching and non-matching records (LEFT, RIGHT, FULL).


This retrieves customers who have placed orders.
